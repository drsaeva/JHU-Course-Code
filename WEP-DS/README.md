# Code for Data Structures

Elevator - dual-stack implementation of a simple data-storage problem
RecursivePathfinding - recursive implementation of recursive DFS of a graph
StackProject - stack-based conversion of infix to postfix formula, calculation of results
determ - Laplace's formula for calculating the determinant of a matrix w/ stack-based storage, linear implementation
determSparse - as above, BUT: does not store 0-valued matrix elements (data-efficient), recursive implementation
sortAnalytics - implementations of Quicksort and Mergesort with built-in timing to compare operation times
